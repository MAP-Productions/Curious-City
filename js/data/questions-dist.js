My question is about how and why pockets of economic depression, crime, and urban decay seem to co-exist right next to otherwise flourishing neighborhoods--what are the invisible forces that make one neighborhood desirable while half a mile away you don't want to walk alone at night? This question is partly driven by the fact that my partner and I are looking to buy a modest home in the Rogers Park\/ Evanston corridor while prices and mortgage rates are tantalizingly low. I'm frustrated by the fact that there are a number of very cute, cozy, affordable homes in residential areas near the Howard red line stop, and yet we are more than hesitant because the area has a seedy reputation. The state of this area is a bit inexplicable because it is not as if it is an urban desert, devoid of infrastructure or services. There is a nice el stop, plenty of viable commercial space, historic architecture and a number of good looking new condo buildings, a police station, and it is close to the lakefront. The area seems to have all the ingredients to be a vibrant and thriving community, but shootings and muggings are commonplace, and the business leave a lot to be desired.

Using a canoe, explorers from Fr. Marquette to Joliet put Chicago's waterways, and Chicago itself, on the map.  \n\nI once heard in an interview on PBS with Ralph Frese, the owner of the Chicagoland Canoe Base, that a person today could travel from downtown Chicago to New Orleans, or New York, or even Billings Montana using only a canoe.  In this true in 2012, even with dams, changing water levels, etc? Has it been attempted in the last 50 years?  \n\nIf Ralph said it, it has to be true.  You should ask him.  He is the most interesting person I have ever met.  Perhaps you can visit him and ask him.  His store is at 4019 North Narragansett Avenue, Chicago, IL 60430 Phone: (773) 777-1489\n\nKeep up the great work.

I remember vaguely that some of the CTA busses ran with or wired to the electrical wires running along the larger streets. Am I remembering correctly? \n\nAnd staying with a question regarding that area, I remember the first gay parade. I think I must have been around 11 years old. And there was a march that was heading not too far from my grade school Nettlehorst on Broadway. There were not any floats just people holding plackards and shouting \"come out of the closet and into the streets.\"  What year was that and how did the gay community pick what was then known as Newtown as their home area.","categories":"history, how we live","imageurl":"http:\/\/farm4.staticflickr.com\/3058\/2625752396_94cae888fb.jpg","imageattribution":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/arrogant\/2625752396\/","imageusername":"Tony","dateuploaded":"1354213489","comments":"0","investigated":"","answered":"","featured":"","reporter":"","updatecount":"","timelinekey":"","badge":""},{"id":"391","name":"Anonymous","question":"Where does all the TIF money go?
